            <p class="text">
                <strong> 
                Investors were left in the dark after troubled property giant Evergrande missed a deadline for a $83.5m (£61m) interest payment.
                </strong> 
            </p>
        
            <p class="text">
                The Chinese firm is yet to make an announcement regarding the payment, which was due on Thursday.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Earlier in the week, the company said it had struck a deal over another interest payment worth $35.9m.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Global markets have been rocked by concerns over the firm's ability to support its more than $300bn of debts.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Evergrande's fell by almost 12% in Hong Kong on Friday after jumping more than 17% the previous day.
            </p>

                    <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-58579833">What is Evergrande and is it too big to fail?</a>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="text">
                Meanwhile, Chinese authorities have reportedly warned local governments to be prepared for the potential failure of Evergrande.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                The actions being ordered were described as "getting ready for the possible storm," according to the Wall Street Journal, which cited officials familiar with the discussions.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                The move has been seen by some investors as a further sign that the Chinese government is reluctant to bail out the crisis-hit real estate giant.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                The Chinese government has made no major announcements on Evergrande, and state media has given few clues about Beijing's thinking on the firm's debt crisis.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                The company is due to make a series of other bond interest payments in the coming weeks.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Under agreements with investors, the company has a 30-day grace period before the missed payment on the $83.5m offshore bond becomes a default.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Some analysts have cautioned that the failure of such a large and heavily-indebted property developer could have a major impact on the Chinese economy, and could potentially spread to the global financial system.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                The real estate industry is a major component of the Chinese economy, accounting for almost 30% of gross domestic product, so any impact on the sector is likely to hit the country's already slowing growth.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                And while there are major risks to both the Chinese property industry and the country's wider economy, only around $20bn of Evergrande's debts are held by foreign investors.
